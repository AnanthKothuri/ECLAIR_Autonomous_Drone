# ECLAIR_Autonomous_Drone
This is a personal repo that contains testing code for YOLO object detection in realtime.

This uses YOLOv8 and potentially YOLOv5, and runs on the NVIDIA Jetson mini GPU. The goal is to create realtime person detection so that we can convert 2d person coordinates to 3d world coordinates.

Much of the code was modified from https://github.com/AnweshCR7/onnx-inference-yolo
